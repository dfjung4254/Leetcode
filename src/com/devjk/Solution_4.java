    LeetCode Problem Solving
    4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
    There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
    Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
    You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

    Time Complexity : O(log(M+N))
